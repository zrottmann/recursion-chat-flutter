## Testing Methodology

### Tools Used
- **Playwright**: Browser automation for consistent testing

- **Metrics Tested**: Load time, responsiveness, touch targets, typography, errors

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Performance and load times
- ✅ Responsive design verification
- ✅ Touch target size analysis
- ✅ JavaScript error detection
- ✅ Typography and readability
- ❌ Cross-browser testing (limited to Chromium)
- ❌ Real device testing (simulator only)

### Limitations
1. **Simulator Testing Only**: No real mobile device testing performed
2. **Network Conditions**: Tested on high-speed connection only
3. **Limited Browsers**: Only Chromium-based testing
4. **Time Constraints**: Some sites had loading issues preventing full testing

## Conclusion

**Critical Issues**: 13 total across all sites  
**Sites Needing Immediate Attention**: All three sites require mobile fixes  
**Estimated Fix Time**: 2-4 weeks for basic mobile compatibility  

The mobile compatibility testing reveals significant issues across all three websites.

Recursion Chat appears to have good mobile code but deployment issues prevent proper testing.

**Next Steps**:
1. Prioritize Trading Post responsive design fixes
2. Implement Slumlord RPG touch controls  
3. Resolve Recursion Chat deployment issues
4. Schedule follow-up testing on real mobile devices
