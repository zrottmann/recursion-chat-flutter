# Claude Code Remote - Manual Deployment Instructions

## ‚úÖ Build Status
The Claude Code Remote Console has been successfully built and packaged for deployment.

## üì¶ Deployment Package
- **File**: `claude-code-remote-deployment.tar.gz`
- **Size**: ~241KB
- **Contents**: Complete Next.js static export ready for Appwrite Sites

## üöÄ Manual Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Appwrite Console (Recommended)
1. Go to [Appwrite Console](https://cloud.appwrite.io/console/project-68a4e3da0022f3e129d0)
2. Navigate to **Hosting** ‚Üí **Sites**
3. Create or select a site:
   - For `chat.appwrite.network`: Create/select site with ID `chat`
   - For `super.appwrite.network`: Create/select site with ID `super`
4. Click **Deploy** ‚Üí **Upload deployment**
5. Upload the `claude-code-remote-deployment.tar.gz` file
6. Wait for deployment to complete
7. Your site will be live at the configured domain

### Option 2: Appwrite CLI (Requires Auth)
```bash
# Login to Appwrite (requires account with proper permissions)
appwrite login

# Configure project
appwrite client --endpoint https://nyc.cloud.appwrite.io/v1 --project-id 68a4e3da0022f3e129d0

# Initialize site
appwrite init site

# Deploy
appwrite deploy site
```

### Option 3: Using API Key with Proper Permissions
You need an API key with the following scopes:
- `sites.write` - For Sites deployment
- `functions.write` - For Functions deployment

Once you have a properly configured API key, run:
```bash
node deploy-with-sdk.js
```

## üîë Current Issue
The current API key lacks the necessary permissions (`sites.write` or `functions.write`) to perform automatic deployment. You'll need to either:
1. Use the Appwrite Console UI (easiest)
2. Generate a new API key with proper permissions
3. Use your account credentials via Appwrite CLI

## üìç Target URLs
Once deployed, the application will be accessible at:
- **Chat Interface**: https://chat.appwrite.network
- **Console Interface**: https://super.appwrite.network

## ‚ú® Features Included
- AI Development Orchestrator interface
- Remote Claude Code agent coordination
- Task management and progress monitoring
- Real-time WebSocket communication support
- Mock API responses for demo mode
- Responsive design for all devices

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
If the sites don't load after deployment:
1. Verify the platform is registered in Appwrite Console
2. Check that the site ID matches the subdomain
3. Ensure the deployment was activated
4. Clear browser cache and try again

## üìù Notes
- The build is production-ready with optimized static assets
- All TypeScript errors have been resolved
- Platform-specific dependencies have been handled
- GitHub Actions workflow is configured for future automated deployments
