# üöÄ Remote.appwrite.network Deployment Instructions

## Current Status
**remote.appwrite.network** is currently showing a 404 error. The deployment packages are ready but require manual upload due to API permission restrictions.

## üì¶ Available Deployment Packages

### 1. Claude Code Remote Console (New Interface)
- **Location**: `C:\Users\Zrott\OneDrive\Desktop\Claude\console\`
- **Package**: `claude-code-remote-deployment.tar.gz`
- **Description**: Modern AI Development Orchestrator interface with remote agent coordination

### 2. Original Claude Code Remote
- **Location**: `C:\Users\Zrott\OneDrive\Desktop\Claude\active-projects\Claude-Code-Remote\`
- **Package**: `remote-site.tar.gz`
- **Description**: Original Claude Code Remote control interface

## üîß Manual Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Access Appwrite Console
1. Go to [Appwrite Console](https://cloud.appwrite.io/console)
2. Select your project (likely one of these):
   - `68a4e3da0022f3e129d0` (Main Console)
   - `68a0db634634a6d0392f` (Slumlord)
   - `689bdaf500072795b0f6` (Recursion)
   - `689bdee000098bd9d55c` (Trading Post)

### Step 2: Create Function for remote.appwrite.network
1. Navigate to **Functions** in the sidebar
2. Click **Create Function**
3. Use these settings:
   - **Function ID**: `remote` (IMPORTANT: Must be exactly "remote")
   - **Name**: Claude Code Remote
   - **Runtime**: Node.js 18.0 or Static
   - **Execute Access**: Any
4. Click **Create**

### Step 3: Deploy the Code
1. Click on the `remote` function you just created
2. Go to the **Deployments** tab
3. Click **Create Deployment**
4. Upload one of the deployment packages:
   - For new console: `claude-code-remote-deployment.tar.gz`
   - For original: `remote-site.tar.gz`
5. Set **Entrypoint**: `index.html`
6. Enable **Activate deployment after build**
7. Click **Create**

### Step 4: Verify Deployment
1. Wait for deployment status to show "Ready"
2. Visit https://remote.appwrite.network
3. The site should now be accessible

## üîë API Key Requirements
If you want to automate deployment, you need an API key with:
- `functions.read` - To check existing functions
- `functions.write` - To create and deploy functions
- `sites.write` - For Sites deployment (alternative)

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: 503 Backend Write Error
**Solution**: This is a temporary Appwrite service issue. Wait a few minutes and try again.

### Issue: 401 Unauthorized
**Solution**: The current API key lacks permissions. Use the Console UI or generate a new API key.

### Issue: 404 Function Not Found
**Solution**: The function with ID "remote" doesn't exist. Create it manually as described above.

### Issue: Site Still Shows 404 After Deployment
**Solution**: 
1. Ensure the function ID is exactly "remote" (not "remote-site" or anything else)
2. Check that the deployment is activated
3. Clear browser cache
4. Verify you're in the correct project

## üìù Alternative Approaches

### Using Appwrite CLI (if you have account access)
```bash
# Login with your account
appwrite login

# Configure project
appwrite client --endpoint https://nyc.cloud.appwrite.io/v1 --project-id [PROJECT_ID]

# Create function
appwrite functions create --functionId remote --name "Claude Code Remote" --runtime node-18.0

# Deploy
appwrite functions createDeployment --functionId remote --entrypoint index.html --code ./remote-site.tar.gz --activate
```

### Using Sites Instead of Functions
If Functions don't work, try creating a Site:
1. Go to **Hosting** ‚Üí **Sites**
2. Create a site with hostname `remote.appwrite.network`
3. Deploy the tar.gz package

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist
- [ ] Function with ID "remote" exists
- [ ] Deployment uploaded successfully
- [ ] Deployment status shows "Ready"
- [ ] Deployment is activated
- [ ] https://remote.appwrite.network loads without 404

## üìû Support
If issues persist:
1. Check Appwrite service status
2. Verify domain configuration in Appwrite Console
3. Contact Appwrite support with deployment ID

## üéØ Expected Result
Once successfully deployed, https://remote.appwrite.network will display the Claude Code Remote interface, allowing remote control of Claude Code sessions.
