# Intelligent Resource Management System

## Overview
The Resource Management System optimizes agent allocation, manages workload distribution, handles priority queuing, and coordinates emergency response teams for maximum efficiency and mission success.

## Components

### 1. Agent Workload Balancing

#### Capacity Management Framework
```yaml
Agent Capacity Model:
  Base Capacity:
    - Maximum concurrent tasks per agent
    - Complexity multipliers for different task types
    - Skill efficiency ratings for task categories
    - Historical performance baselines
    
  Dynamic Adjustments:
    - Current workload percentage
    - Recent performance trends
    - Agent availability windows
    - Context switching overhead
```

#### Workload Distribution Algorithm
```yaml
Load Balancing Strategy:
  1. Capacity Assessment:
     - Calculate available agent capacity
     - Factor in task complexity requirements
     - Consider skill-task alignment efficiency
     
  2. Optimal Assignment:
     - Match tasks to agents with highest efficiency
     - Balance workload across team members
     - Minimize context switching overhead
     
  3. Overload Prevention:
     - Monitor agent utilization rates
     - Trigger workload redistribution at 85% capacity
     - Activate backup agents when needed
     
  4. Performance Optimization:
     - Track completion rates and quality scores
     - Adjust future assignments based on performance
     - Identify skill development opportunities
```

#### Agent Capacity Matrix
```yaml
Agent Capacity Example:

┌─────────────────────┬──────────┬─────────┬──────────┬─────────────┐
│ Agent               │ Max Load │ Current │ Skill    │ Efficiency  │
├─────────────────────┼──────────┼─────────┼──────────┼─────────────┤
│ react-expert        │ 100%     │ 75%     │ Frontend │ 95%         │
│ django-expert       │ 100%     │ 45%     │ Backend  │ 98%         │
│ devops-engineer     │ 100%     │ 90% ⚠️  │ DevOps   │ 92%         │
│ security-auditor    │ 100%     │ 30%     │ Security │ 90%         │
│ api-architect       │ 100%     │ 60%     │ Design   │ 93%         │
└─────────────────────┴──────────┴─────────┴──────────┴─────────────┘

Recommendations:
- Redistribute tasks from devops-engineer (overloaded)
- Utilize security-auditor capacity for additional reviews
- Consider parallel task assignment for django-expert
```

#### Load Balancing Triggers
```yaml
Rebalancing Conditions:
  - Agent utilization > 85% for more than 2 hours
  - Task queue depth > 3 for any single agent
  - Mission timeline at risk due to resource constraints
  - Agent reports burnout or requests workload reduction
  - Quality scores declining due to overwork
```

### 2. Priority Queue Management

#### Task Prioritization Framework
```yaml
Priority Scoring Matrix:
  Business Impact (40%):
    - Critical path dependency: 40 points
    - User-facing feature: 30 points
    - Internal optimization: 20 points
    - Nice-to-have feature: 10 points
    
  Urgency (30%):
    - Blocking other tasks: 30 points
    - Time-sensitive deadline: 25 points
    - Regular milestone: 15 points
    - Future planning: 5 points
    
  Resource Efficiency (20%):
    - Agent expertise match: 20 points
    - Available capacity: 15 points
    - Context switching cost: -10 points
    - Learning curve required: -5 points
    
  Risk Mitigation (10%):
    - Reduces project risk: 10 points
    - Addresses technical debt: 8 points
    - Improves maintainability: 5 points
    - Refactoring only: 2 points

Total Priority Score: 0-100 (Higher = More Priority)
```

#### Dynamic Priority Adjustment
```yaml
Priority Modifiers:
  Time-Based:
    - Approaching deadline: +20 points
    - Blocking critical path: +30 points
    - Dependency resolution: +25 points
    
  Quality-Based:
    - Previous failed quality gates: +15 points
    - Security vulnerability: +35 points
    - Performance degradation: +20 points
    
  Resource-Based:
    - Agent expertise perfect match: +10 points
    - Agent overutilized: -15 points
    - Requires specialized skills: +5 points
```

#### Queue Management Algorithms
```yaml
Queue Processing Strategies:

Weighted Round Robin:
  - Assigns tasks based on priority scores
  - Ensures high-priority tasks get processed first
  - Prevents starvation of lower-priority tasks
  
Earliest Deadline First:
  - Prioritizes tasks with nearest deadlines
  - Optimizes for timeline adherence
  - Best for mission-critical deployments
  
Skill-Based Assignment:
  - Matches tasks to agent expertise
  - Maximizes efficiency and quality
  - Reduces context switching overhead
  
Load-Balanced Distribution:
  - Distributes tasks evenly across agents
  - Prevents agent overload
  - Maintains team morale and sustainability
```
