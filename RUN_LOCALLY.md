# 🚀 Run Flutter Recursion Chat Locally

Since you have Flutter installed, here's how to get the app running on your local machine:

## ✅ Quick Setup (You Already Have Flutter)

### Step 1: Open Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell

```cmd
# Navigate to the Flutter project
cd C:\Users\Zrott\recursion_chat_flutter

# Add Flutter to your PATH for this session (if not already)
set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Users\Zrott\Downloads\flutter_windows_3.32.8-stable\flutter\bin
```

### Step 2: Verify Flutter Installation

```cmd
flutter --version
flutter doctor
```

### Step 3: Install Project Dependencies  

```cmd
flutter pub get
```

### Step 4: Configure Appwrite (Optional for Testing)

Edit `lib/services/appwrite_service.dart` and update:

```dart
static const String endpoint = 'https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1';
static const String projectId = '67432fe4001a2ab30fb8';  // Your project ID
```

### Step 5: Run the Flutter App

```cmd
# Run on Chrome (recommended)
flutter run -d chrome

# Or run on Windows desktop
flutter run -d windows

# Or list available devices first
flutter devices
```

## 🎯 What You'll See

The Flutter app will start with:
- ✅ **Modern Material Design 3 UI**
- ✅ **Stable authentication screen** (no React Error #301!)  
- ✅ **Real-time chat interface**
- ✅ **Room selection screen**
- ✅ **Cross-platform responsive design**

## 🛠️ Alternative: Use the Batch File

I created a batch file for you:

```cmd
# Double-click or run from cmd:
C:\Users\Zrott\flutter-run.bat
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**If Flutter command not found:**
```cmd
# Add Flutter to Windows System PATH permanently:
# 1. Windows Key + R → type "sysdm.cpl"
# 2. Advanced → Environment Variables
# 3. Add to PATH: C:\Users\Zrott\Downloads\flutter_windows_3.32.8-stable\flutter\bin
```

**If dependencies fail:**
```cmd
flutter clean
flutter pub get
```

**If web doesn't work:**
```cmd
flutter config --enable-web
flutter create . --platforms=web
flutter pub get
flutter run -d chrome
```

## 🎉 Expected Result

You should see the **complete Flutter recursion chat application** running locally with:

1. **Authentication Screen** - Clean, no infinite loops
2. **Room Selection** - Choose from available chat rooms  
3. **Chat Interface** - Real-time messaging with Material Design
4. **Responsive UI** - Works perfectly on web and desktop

## 📱 Mobile Testing

To test on mobile:
```cmd
# For Android (requires Android Studio)
flutter run -d android

# For iOS (requires Xcode on macOS)  
flutter run -d ios
```

## 🌐 Build for Production

To create a web build:
```cmd
flutter build web --release
# Output will be in: build/web/
```
