# Enhanced Quality Gate System

## Overview
The Quality Gate System enforces automated quality checkpoints, definition of done criteria, rollback protocols, and compliance validation throughout the software development lifecycle.

## Components

### 1. Automated Quality Checkpoints

```

#### Automated Quality Checks
```yaml
Code Quality Gates:

  - Performance: Load time < 2s, Memory usage within limits
```

#### Quality Scoring Matrix
```yaml
Quality Score Calculation:
  Code Quality (30%):
    - Linting compliance: 0-100
    - Code complexity: 0-100
    - Documentation coverage: 0-100
    
  Testing (25%):
    - Unit test coverage: 0-100
    - Integration test success: 0-100
    - E2E test coverage: 0-100
    
  Security (25%):
    - Vulnerability scan results: 0-100
    - Security best practices: 0-100
    - Access control validation: 0-100
    
  Performance (20%):
    - Load time benchmarks: 0-100
