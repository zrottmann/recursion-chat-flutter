### A note about licenses

Because simply listing a hyperlink does not qualify as redistribution, the license of the original source is not relevant to its inclusion. However, for posterity and convenience, we do host copies of all resources whose license permits it. Therefore, please include information about the resource's license. Additionally, take note: _if you do not include a LICENSE in your GitHub repo, then by default it is fully copyrighted and redistribution is not allowed_. So, if you are intending to make an open source project, it's critical to pick from one of the many available open source licenses. This is just a reminder that without a LICENSE, your project is not open source (it's merely source-code-available) - it may of course still be included on this list, but this notice is to inform readers about the default rules regarding GitHub and LICENSE files. See [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository) for more details.
