# üö® URGENT: Fix OAuth Platform Registration for Trading Post

## Error You're Seeing:
```
Error 400: Invalid 'success' param: Invalid URI. 
Register your new client (tradingpost.appwrite.network) as a new Web platform
```

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION: Manual Platform Registration (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Open Appwrite Console
Go to: https://cloud.appwrite.io/console/project-689bdee000098bd9d55c

### Step 2: Navigate to Platforms
- Method A: Click "Overview" ‚Üí Look for "Platforms" section ‚Üí Click "Add platform"
- Method B: Click "Settings" (left sidebar) ‚Üí Click "Platforms" ‚Üí Click "Add platform"
- Method C: Direct link: https://cloud.appwrite.io/console/project-689bdee000098bd9d55c/settings/platforms

### Step 3: Add Web Platform
Click "Add platform" ‚Üí Select "Web App"

### Step 4: Register Primary Domain
- **Name:** `Trading Post - Main`
- **Hostname:** `tradingpost.appwrite.network`
- Click "Create"

### Step 5: Register Backup Domain
Click "Add platform" again ‚Üí "Web App"
- **Name:** `Trading Post - Global`
- **Hostname:** `689cb415001a367e69f8.appwrite.global`
- Click "Create"

### Step 6: Register Development Domains
Repeat for each:
- **Name:** `Trading Post - Local 3000` / **Hostname:** `localhost:3000`
- **Name:** `Trading Post - Local 5173` / **Hostname:** `localhost:5173`
- **Name:** `Trading Post - Local 5174` / **Hostname:** `localhost:5174`

## üéØ After Registration:
1. OAuth will work immediately - no code changes needed
2. Test at: https://tradingpost.appwrite.network
3. Click "Sign in with Google" - should work without errors

## üìù Why This Happens:
- Appwrite requires explicit platform registration for security
- Each domain that uses OAuth must be pre-registered
- This prevents unauthorized domains from using your OAuth credentials

## üîß Already Registered Platforms:
To check what's already registered:
1. Go to: https://cloud.appwrite.io/console/project-689bdee000098bd9d55c/settings/platforms
2. You'll see a list of all registered platforms
3. Make sure `tradingpost.appwrite.network` is in the list

## ‚ö° Quick Test:
After adding the platforms, test immediately:
```bash
# Open in browser
start https://tradingpost.appwrite.network
```
Then click "Sign in with Google" - it should work!

**Time Required:** 5 minutes
**Difficulty:** Easy (just clicking in UI)
