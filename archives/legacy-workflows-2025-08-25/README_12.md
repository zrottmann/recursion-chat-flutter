## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ for WebSocket server
- AI agents capable of WebSocket communication
- Basic development environment setup

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the agent swarm orchestrator
git clone https://github.com/your-org/agent-swarm-orchestrator.git
cd agent-swarm-orchestrator

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the orchestrator server
npm start

# Open the operations dashboard
# Open examples/demo-operations-center-enhanced.html in your browser
```

### Basic Usage
```javascript
// Connect to the orchestrator via WebSocket
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080');

// Register as an agent
ws.send(JSON.stringify({
  type: 'agent:register',
  payload: {
    id: 'backend-expert',
    capabilities: ['node.js', 'database', 'api-design'],
    status: 'available'
  }
}));

// Receive and handle missions
ws.on('message', (data) => {
  const message = JSON.parse(data);
  if (message.type === 'mission:assigned') {
    // Execute the assigned task
    executeTask(message.payload);
  }
});
```
