# üéÆ Slum Lord Combat & Logging Test Instructions

## ‚úÖ **FIXED ISSUES**

1. **Combat System**: Enhanced Combat System is properly integrated with physics-based hit detection
2. **Player Creation**: Player is created at (100, 100) with proper stats
3. **Error Handling**: Added initialization checks to prevent null player errors
4. **Logging System**: Enhanced with type grouping and ` key toggle

## üéØ **How to Test Combat**

### **Step 1: Load the Game**
- Open http://localhost:8080
- Wait for "Loading RPG-JS Engine..." to complete
- Game should show player (üë§) and enemies (üë∫üê∫)

### **Step 2: Test Movement**
- Use **WASD** or **Arrow Keys** to move the player
- Player should move smoothly around the map

### **Step 3: Test Combat**
- Move near a monster (Forest Goblin üë∫ or Wild Wolf üê∫)
- Press **Spacebar** to attack when close to enemy
- **Expected Results:**
  - Combat logs should appear in console
  - Enemy health should decrease
  - Visual effects should show
  - XP/Gold rewards when enemy dies

### **Step 4: Test Enhanced Logging**
- Press **` key** (backtick) to open debug console viewer
- **Filter buttons** should show:
  - ALL LOGS (total count)
  - COMBAT (combat-specific logs)
  - RENDER (rendering logs)
  - SPRITE (entity logs)
  - ERROR, WARN, SUCCESS, INFO, GENERAL
- Click **Copy Logs** to copy current filter to clipboard
- **Keyboard shortcuts:**
  - `` ` `` = All logs
  - `Ctrl + `` = Combat logs only
  - `Alt + `` = Render logs only

## üêõ **Troubleshooting**

### **If Combat Doesn't Work:**
1. Press ` key and check COMBAT logs
2. Look for messages like:
   - "Looking for nearby monsters..."
   - "Found X nearby monsters"
   - "Attacking [monster name]"

### **If Player is Null Error:**
1. Check initialization logs
2. Look for "Game engine not fully initialized yet!"
3. Wait for full initialization before attacking

### **Common Issues:**
- **No enemies visible**: Check SPRITE logs for entity creation
- **Attack does nothing**: Ensure you're within 60px range of enemy
- **Console errors**: Check ERROR logs in console viewer
